VMWare tools for CoreOS in Docker image

This image is intended to provide VMWare Tools for CoreOS running under *VMWare ESXi* without modification of CoreOS.
You have run it in privileged mode to give access to the host system and I prefere to run it with 
option `--net=host` to see all IP addresses of host in vSphere client.

### Done
* Quiesce file system to make consistent snapshots
* vSphere can "see" all VM properties from CoreOS: hostname, IP addresses, etc...

### Not done yet
* You can't graceful shutdown the CoreOS system from vSphere client. I've made script `send-host-to-shutdown.sh` 
which run when you try "Shutdown Guest" but it still empty because I don't know yet how to shutdown Docker host from container.

# Usage

You can run this container manually but I recommend to add it as systemd service to run it on every boot.
Below you can see example for `cloud-config`.

## From cloud-config
```
#cloud-config

coreos:

        ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm vmware-tools
        ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --net=host --privileged --name vmware-tools sergeyzh/vmware-tools
        ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop vmware-tools
        ExecStopPost=-/usr/bin/docker rm vmware-tools
```
